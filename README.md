# Windows-command-line

### `@` sign

The `@` symbol tells the command processor to be less verbose; to only show the output of the command without showing it being executed or any prompts associated with the execution. When used it is prepended to the beginning of the command, it is not necessary to leave a space between the "@" and the command.

For example:

 If we did `@echo off`, It would've shown echo off on the command line, however with @ you can make it so it doesn't show it.
